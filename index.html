            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hello! My name is Tiger Yang, and ever since becoming interested in frontend web development, I've always been into pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the medium and creating online experiences that others won't soon forget.</p>
            <p>Browser compatibility often finds itself at the bottom of my priorities, as I employ the most experimental and cutting-edge APIs to make my dreams into reality.</p>
            <p>I also highly prioritize optimization. The stereotype of websites being fundamentally slower than native apps is something I wish to fight, and because of that, I tend to never use third-party libraries and frameworks, as in my mind, "nothing" will always be faster than "anything".</p>

            <h2>Project Process Analysis One</h2>

            <p>Shortly after graduation from high school, I had what I considered to be a brilliant idea. Instead of splurging on a hign-perfrmance laptop that was thick, heavy, power hungry, hot, and unupgradable, I could use remote access software to control my home computer from my existing laptop, redirecting the money I saved to upgrade my home computer to be more powerful than any laptop could achieve. However, all existing remote access software had pain points of various kinds, such as unreliable connections, agressive bandwitch hogging, unacceptably high latency, and audio video syncronization problems,. This led me to attempt to write my own remote access software from scratch, with guidance from ChatGPT</p>

            <p>I wanted my app to be as low-level and optomized as possible, so I decided to write it in c++ so that I can interface direcly with Window's Desktop Duplication API and Nvidia's Video Codec SDK to capture the display frames within GPU memory, and encode it to HEVC with ultra low latecny using the GPU's dedicated video engine. </p>

            <p>For audio, I interfaced directly with Window's Audio Session API and LibOpus to capture the speaker output and encode it using the OPUS codec.</p>
            <img src="media/anal1_3.png">
            <p>for mouse and keyboard emulation, I originally wanted to use window's acessibility APIs, but I quickly realized that nothing offered by windows would work in the secure desktop, such as a UAC prompt, so I pivoted to using a Raspberry Pi attached to the computer, which via it's usb port's OTG functionality, allows it to masquerade as a keyboard and mouse, completely fooling windows.</p>
            <img src="media/anal1_4.jpeg">
            <p>I decided to implement the client as a website using Javascript and it's WebTransport, WebCodecs, Canvas, and Web Audio APIs to communicate with the server using QUIC, decode the arriving video and audio bitstreams using the client device's hardware or software decoders, and display the decoded video and audio frames to the user.</p>
